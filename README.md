Hey there, this is the help file for Phish-Shield: A Cyber Security Solution.
So, First let's understand what is Phish-Shield is about.
To understand what is Phish-Shield, we need to first understand

What is Phishing?

Phishing is a simplest way of attack to steal the user credentials like Social media account passwords, 
credit/debit card information etc. This attack basically focuses on stealing the confidential information about the user. 
Generally, technical persons don’t get trapped in this fraud. 
The main targets of the attacks are senior citizens, kids and other non-technical persons. 
The process of the attack is first attacker traps their target by sending fake emails, messages etc. 
So, to overcome and prevent users from getting trapped in this attack we are creating phish-shield a free cyber security solution.
The methods we going to use are Machin Learning and Web scraping.
Basically, python will be used at backed to perform classification of safe, doubtful and suspicious URL.
The dataset used for training the ML model contains 18 features based on which the model will decides that whether the URL is suspicious or it is safe.
In order to check the link user needs to copy it and paste it in our application.
Then the user will be prompted about the URL.
Also, to increase the accuracy we also create some blacklisted URL’s DB from which we search for entered URL.
And user will get prompted accordingly.
Web scraping is also done to check if this page is cloned or same page exist on a internet.
This will increase the accuracy of the project to another level.
Our method deals with machine learning technology for detection of phishing URLs by extracting and analyzing various features of legitimate and phishing URLs.
Decision Tree, random forest and Support vector machine algorithms are used to detect phishing websites.

Now we know what is phishing and how it works and attacker traps the target. Now the question arises how we can avoid this attack by using Phish-Shield.
Phish-Shield will help detect you these fraud websites and URL. So that we can stay safe from these attacks. This what Phish-Shield is all about.
Now you must be thinking how we can use your service. Let's understand the steps you need to follow in order to detect these websites.

Step 1:
	Whenever you get some website from any source that is suspicious, Just copy that URL.

Step 2:
	Visit our website/download our android app. You can find our app directly from website too.
	Website: https://vrjvoid.github.io/PhishShield/
	App: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iy37nV55c9blj-eNr34p9lU5o315_m4M/view

Step 3:
	Then for website: 
		1. Just go to service tab.
		2. Click on Search button.
		3. Paste that copied URL and click search.
	For app:
		1. Open app
		2. Login/Register with your details.
		3. Go to "Detect Phishing" tab.
		4. Paste URL in search box and click "DETECT".
	Now, the task is done. Just wait for the results to appear. And you will get the results on your screen.

That's it. Just doing these simple steps you can assure your security.
